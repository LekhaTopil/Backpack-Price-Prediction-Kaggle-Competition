# 🎒 **Backpack Price Prediction | EDA | LightGBM**

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting backpack prices using machine learning techniques, with a primary emphasis on data exploration, feature engineering, and model optimization. I developed a **LightGBM-based regression model** and achieved an **RMSE of 38.93**, placing within a very close margin of the top leaderboard score of **38.61** in a competitive setting.

## 🔍 **Key Highlights**

✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified trends and patterns in the dataset.

✅ **Handling Missing Values:** Used **mean imputation** for continuous variables and **random imputation** for categorical data to   
     retain distribution integrity.

✅ **Feature Engineering:** Created meaningful categorical interactions to enhance predictive power.

✅ **Model Development:** Leveraged LightGBM, a high-performance gradient boosting framework.

✅ **Cross-Validation Strategy:** Implemented **5-fold KFold validation** for robust performance evaluation.

✅ **Model Performance:** Evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).**

✅ **Feature Importance Analysis:** Explored key contributing factors to backpack pricing.
